    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>I’m tired of people complaining that they’re tired. That they’re bored. That they hate what they do, and do what they hate, and live in this constant cycle of meh and blah and ugh.

Life is too short to wake up every morning and wish the day away. Life is too short to spend all week praying for the weekends, and then spend all weekend feeling purposeless and empty. Life is too short to focus so much time and attention on the negative—what we don’t have, what we don’t like, what we wish we could change.

Honestly, our time on earth is too precious to waste doing anything but soaking life in, celebrating every moment, and surrounding yourself with people who feel and do the same.

That’s why the only people I want to be around are the ones with a lust for life.

The ones who wakeup and decide to conquer every day. The ones who smile at the sunrise, who dance in their car at red lights, who sing in the long stretches of traffic.

I want to be around the ones who quit their dead-end jobs to follow their dreams, or pursue careers they love, or even in the monotony of their 9 to 5 workweek, find time for their passions.

I want to be around the people who love to hug, who love to kiss, who love to laugh and enjoy every second with the ones they care for.

I want to be around the people that don’t just give up, but pursue who and what they love relentlessly, who don’t just ho-hum along the beaten path, but wander and embrace every moment, good and bad, with open arms and a wide smile.

I want to be around the people who order too much food and tell crazy stories. The ones who are animated and loud, filled with a wild love for being human, and all of the roller-coaster ups and downs that come with.

I want to be around the people who climb mountains, who go for walks, who take pictures of anything and everything and hang the Polaroids on their walls. The ones who can’t wait to meet new people, try new things, experience the places and bodies outside their own.

I want to be around the people with a lust for life—who don’t sit stagnant and blah, but are hands up in the front row of the ride.
I want to surround myself with the people who smile, even after pain. The ones who forgive and step forward, who tell jokes with strangers, who go on adventures, who are always searching for ways to learn and grow and change.

I want to be around the people who love life, unapologetically. The ones who find light even in the worst circumstances and who spread that light with others.

I want to be around the people who watch sunsets, who hold hands, who write poetry and walk barefoot and ask people how they feel and really listen to the answer. The ones who find stories in the ocean, who find peace in the wind and the trees, who seek love in people and believe in it, no matter how many times their hearts have been broken.

I want to be around the people who, despite the wrong, the broken, the damaged, the hurt, can still find something beautiful in the world. And who wake up every day celebrating their discoveries.

I want to be around the people who love living, the ones who teach me how it feels to be alive.
