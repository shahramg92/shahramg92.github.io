    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p> A few days back, I participated in a Presentation Skills workshop. As part of this workshop, I had to give a 4-minute presentation on any chosen topic from a list. I chose: I’m passionate about ____, and here’s why. Initially, I took some time trying to think what I was passionate about. The answer came to me in a few seconds(I hate the fact that it even took a few seconds). When I realized I was going to talk about music, I knew it wouldn’t be very difficult. After all, I love music! So I went back to the title so I could officially start working on the content, and that’s when it hit me. The title said “here’s why”. And I had no ready answer to that! This entry is going to be a bit of the self-exploration I went through as I tried to answer the question of why I believed music is my passion.

When you really like something, you often don’t give it a second thought. Without you realizing, it becomes a staple in your life – like food or water, and you can’t imagine its absence. It’s a part of you. That’s how music is to me.

I’ve been learning Indian Classical music(Carnatic) for around 10 years. I have also been a regular student at my school choir for all my school life. Initially I used to go to music classes because my parents asked me to. Also because I liked playing Badminton with my friends after class. So when academics got overwhelming, it wasn’t difficult for me to find an excuse to stop learning music. Despite this not-really-interested phase of learning music, thanks to good teachers and my in-built need to excel at what I do, I learnt quite a lot. Music was already becoming a part of my life. So when I stopped practicing music, there was a hole. That’s when the transition happened.  That’s when I knew I needed music in my life. From then on, I went back to music with an extra vigor. It showed in my progress. Music had moved on from being a small part of my life to a passion.

The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of why I’m passionate about music is: music is relaxing to me. It takes me to a whole new world where there are no worries or assignments or deadlines! It holds my attention and is probably the only thing I can concentrate on without getting distracted in 5 minutes. My mind doesn’t wander and this energizes me. It is refreshing and stimulating and I can go back to any other chore, inspired. The music I’m talking about here is of course not the background music we play while studying or driving but what I call “fore-ground music”; the one where you’re actively participating in singing or listening just for the sake of music in itself. This is the aspect of music which gives it a power of healing.

To me, music is more than just sound: it’s an art with rhythm, tune, emotion and meaning. In this sense, music can be inspiring and empowering. I believe music can be thought of as analogous to paint. You can splash paint around and have fun or create something valuable and complicated. But the best bet is to paint a beautiful picture and convey something. So too music can be fun, complicated or something meaningful and motivating. It can convey feelings of patriotism, sorrow, happiness, inspiration or spirituality that can stir up emotion and bring about change. This, I believe is the best form of music and the reason for its evolution over the ages as a means of communication.

Music is mathematics in its rhythm, logic in its composition, science in its octaves and pitches (In 600 BC, Pythagoras called music a science when he developed the Octave scale) and technology in its instruments and digitization. I think music is a field that deserves to be celebrated as much as engineering, medicine or law as it is just as much or probably even more powerful than any of these! I only wish I had realized this much when I was still trying to figure out my career many years back.

Music will always be one major part of my life, but I really hope I find the bridge to make it the most important.
